--Task 6

 If the user CSE302_S2_F22 revoke the power from U1
U1 will not be vanished. U2 is generously giving grant access to U1. 
But if we want to give the power to grant option to users, we'll need to use U2. 
Since user U1 can't give power to user U3, user U3 will eventually lose its power.
